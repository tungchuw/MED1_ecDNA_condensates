This file explains how to use the data for plotting Fig 2B, C.

1. File name: Fig.2B, C_PC3DM_DiffBind_output_for_plot.csv

Description:
This file contains the DiffBind (version 3.8.4) results for PC3 DM cells under 1,6 hexanediol (1,6-HD) treatment.
It includes two comparisons:
- 3% 1,6-HD for 30 minutes vs untreated control.
- 3% 1,6-HD for 60 minutes vs untreated control.

Each row represents a genomic peak with statistics, including fold change, p value and FDR for both comparisons.
annotation columns  
- EC == TRUE means the peak is on ecDNA; FALSE means it is on a chromosomal region. 
- rankSE == 0 means the peak is not part of a super-enhancer (SE); a integer indicates its rank among SEs.

How to generate data for PC3 DM in Fig 2B:
Subset the file to include peaks with FDR less than 0.01 in each individual comparison.
For 30 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 30min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
For 60 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 60min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
Use these two subsets for separate plotting.

How to generate data for PC3 DM in Fig 2C:
Create a union of peaks where FDR is less than 0.01 in at least one of the two comparisons.
That is keep any row where either FDR 30min vs 0 is less than 0.01 or FDR 60min vs 0 is less than 0.01.

2. File name: Fig.2B, C_COLO320DM_DiffBind_output_for_plot.csv

Description:
This file contains the DiffBind (version 3.8.4) results for COLO320 DM cells under 1,6 hexanediol (1,6-HD) treatment.
It includes four comparisons:
- 3% 1,6-HD for 30 minutes vs untreated control.
- 3% 1,6-HD for 60 minutes vs untreated control.
- 3% 1,6-HD for 120 minutes vs untreated control.
- 3% 1,6-HD for 180 minutes vs untreated control.

Each row represents a genomic peak with statistics, including fold change, p value and FDR for both comparisons.
annotation columns  
- EC == TRUE means the peak is on ecDNA; FALSE means it is on a chromosomal region. 
- rankSE == 0 means the peak is not part of a super-enhancer (SE); a integer indicates its rank among SEs.

For 60 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 60min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
For 120 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 120min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
For 180 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 180min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
Use these four subsets for separate plotting.

2. File name: Fig.2B, C_GBM171DM_DiffBind_output_for_plot.csv

Description:
This file contains the DiffBind (version 3.8.4) results for GBM171 DM cells under 1,6 hexanediol (1,6-HD) treatment.
It includes two comparisons:
- 3% 1,6-HD for 60 minutes vs untreated control.
- 3% 1,6-HD for 120 minutes vs untreated control.

Subset the file to include peaks with FDR less than 0.01 in each individual comparison.
For 60 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 60min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
For 120 minute comparison keep rows where FDR 120min vs 0 is less than 0.01.
